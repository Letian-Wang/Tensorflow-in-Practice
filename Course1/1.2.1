more neuron: 
    more accurate, more time.
    But not "more is better", there exists a law of diminishing returns

more layer:
    for more complex data

more epoch:
    more accurate, loss fluctuates due to overfitting
    when the loss fluctuate, no need to train more

stop when accuracy is satisfied
    use callback
