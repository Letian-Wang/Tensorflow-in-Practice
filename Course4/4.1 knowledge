1. data synthesis:
    trend: monotuneous
    seasonality: repeatation
    noise
    autocorrelation: data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different

2. temrs
    univariate time series: hour by hour temperature
    multivariate time series: hour by hour weather

    imputed data: A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data
    non-stationary: one that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality
    naive prediction: new value equals to last value
     
    moving average: average of moving window (eliminate noise) (trainling/centered window)
    differencing: remove trend and seasonality (Series(t) - Series(t-T)), need to restore

3. patition:
    fixed partitioning: training period,    validation period,  test period
        1. fine-tuning on training data and validation data
        2. train on training data and validation data
        3. test on test data

    roll-forward partitioning


4.Metrics:
    errors = forecasts - actual
    mse = np.square(errors).mean()
    rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
    mae = np.abs(erros).mean()
    keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, naive_forcast).numpy()
    mape = np.abs(errors / x_valid).mean()
