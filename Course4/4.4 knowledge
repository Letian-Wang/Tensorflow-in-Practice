tuning while training:
    learning rate: naive train with learningRateScheduler
    window_size: seasonality
    split_time: ratio of training and testing
    neuron number: experiment
    network: CNN, DNN, RNN
    generalization: dropout, regularizer
    epoch: longer, fitter
    batch_size: need to be tried (should be big enough to avoid further noise, but not too big)
